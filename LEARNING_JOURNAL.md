## Sprint 1 — Project Bootstrap

### T1.1 — Initialize backend project with `uv`

**Date:** 2026-07-13

**What was done:**
- Installed `uv` and initialized `backend/` as a `uv`-managed Python project pinned to Python 3.12.
- This generated `pyproject.toml` (project metadata + dependencies), `.python-version` (pins the interpreter version), and — on first `uv run` — `.venv` (isolated environment) and `uv.lock` (locked, reproducible dependency versions).
- Verified the environment end-to-end with `uv run main.py`, which downloaded CPython 3.12 and executed successfully.
- Removed the placeholder `main.py` `uv init` generates by default — it's flat boilerplate that doesn't match the layered `app/` structure planned for T1.2.

**Why:**
`uv` was chosen over `pip + requirements.txt` / Poetry because it's a single tool for both interpreter version management and dependency resolution, and it produces a lockfile. Reproducibility matters for a project that explicitly aims to be production-quality, not a script that only runs on one machine. This had to be the first backend ticket because every later piece (FastAPI app, health endpoint, Docker image) depends on having a working, pinned Python environment underneath it.

**Problem it solved:**
`backend/` was an empty folder with no way to install or pin dependencies. Now every dependency added in later tickets resolves into `uv.lock`, so the environment stays reproducible across machines instead of drifting.

**Gotchas encountered:**
- Homebrew failed to install `uv` because `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib` weren't writable by the user (would have required `sudo chown` on shared system directories). Used `pip install --user uv` instead — installs to the user's own site-packages, no sudo needed.
- The `pip --user` install location (`~/Library/Python/3.14/bin`) isn't on `PATH` by default — had to add `export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.14/bin:$PATH"` to `~/.zshrc`.
- The coding sandbox's Bash tool runs non-interactive shells that don't source `.zshrc`, so commands during the session had to reference `uv`'s full path directly. This is a sandbox quirk only — the user's actual terminal picks up the `PATH` change normally.
